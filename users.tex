In this section, we will use a common metric of user activity in online communities, the number of posts per user over time. 
%% DC 12: This would be the place to briefly lay out other work that has addressed this question. 

As we will see, both visualizing behavior relative to a user's join time rather than calendar time and using cohorts provide additional insight into how people's posting frequency in Reddit 
The first approach uses a notion of time relative to an event of interest (such as a user's first post); the second focuses on cohort effects.

\subsection{The Aggregate View of Users' Activity}

Figure~\ref{fig:overall_posts}a shows the average number of posts (submissions plus comments) per month by users who were active in that month.  Taken at face value, this suggests that over the first few years of Reddit, users became more active in posting and that per-user activity has remained more or less steady since mid-2011.

\subsection{Activity relative to a user's lifespan}

%\caption{Evolution of all users in reddit. The x-axis is the time from the user creation referential, i.e., each message creation time is measured in terms of when the user was created. Each tick is one year and we discretized time by month --- the n-th bin holds messages the user wrote in the n-th month. The user count for each month is the number of users that were active, that is, the users that authored at least one post in their n-th month. Since we are looking at the user time referential, you can understand this as the surviving users after x time. The y-axis is the number of posts per active users. }
%\label{fig:avr_posts_per_user_user_ref_total}
%\end{figure}
%% DC 10: This is the new figure, the one that's adjusted to be relative to user creation date like Figure 5 but aggreated over all users rather than separated by cohort.

%% DC 10: This is my best guess as to what the aggregate version of the avr_posts_per_user_cohorts figure looks like
This average view hides several important aspects of users' activity dynamics.  In Figure~\ref{fig:overall_posts}b, we show a different view that emphasizes the trajectory over a user's lifespan.  Here, we scale the x-axis not by clock time, as in the left figure, but by time since the user's first post: ``1'' on the x-axis refers to one year since the user's account first post, and so on. We define this date as the \textbf{account creation time}.
One caution about interpreting the graphs that are relative to the user's start time is that the amount of data available rapidly decreases over time, meaning that values toward the right side of an individual data series are more subject to individual variation.  
%% DC 10: The way to really handle this would probably be confidence intervals, but we should at least note it somewhere and this is the best way I could think of for now.

%% Sam 12: This conclusion is wrong. The three graphic row show that when you have users that you know will survive, their posting actually decreases. This curve goes up because the users that don't post die and stop dragging the average down.

%This figure shows that a user's tenure matters: the longer a user survives, the more posts they make over time.  Interestingly, we see that the curve rises much higher than it does in Figure~\ref{fig:avr_posts_per_user_over_time_total}: users who survive over five years have almost 50\% more posts per year than average. 

A tempting conclusion at this point is: the longer a user survives, the more posts they make over time. This, however, is not exactly why we see this curve increasing from the user-time referential. The correct interpretation here is: given that the user survived, his/her posting average is going to be higher. As we will see, cohorting and segmenting the users will reveal more of the underlying process. 


\subsection{Cohort-based views of posting activity}

\end{figure*}

%% DC 12: I get why you're doing this to make it easier to compare the analyses, and I think I would be fine with the combined overall/cohort graphs _after_ the first one.  But the first one _cannot_ do this -- especially on this one where we're putting it together with the wonky join date-anomalous cohort graph.  One of our giant points is to show how the overall views are misleading, and we combining them in this way makes it harder to tell that story: what we would see if we just did the base analysis.  Combining it with the weirdo cohort lines is also just bad -- here are two different analyses that are confusing and somewhat wrong.

%% DC 12: I also can't do much here with editing, since the figures and text now don't match.  

%\begin{figure}[!tb]
%\centering
%\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{./images/avr_posts_per_user_cohorts.eps}
%\caption{Number of posts per active user for  the overall set of users and cohorts on the user creation date. The x-axis is the time from the user creation referential, i.e., each message creation time is measured in terms of when the user was created. Each tick is one year and we discretized time by month --- the n-th bin holds messages the user wrote in the n-th month. Since we are looking at the user time referential, you can understand this as the surviving users after x time. An interpretation of this says ``users that survived x time are posting on average y messages''. Here we see that, although the 2008 cohort level at a higher value, the evolution of the number of posts took a longer time to increase. The other cohorts seem to follow a more regular pattern after the first year: older users that survived the first year post more on average than younger users that survived the first year. Since we are talking about surviving users, it is not clear from this figure whether these curves increase because the ``low posting users'' are dying earlier or because the users are actually increasing their activity as they live on. To differentiate these cases, Figure \ref{fig:avr_posts_per_user_for_surviving_year} shows, for each cohort, the average posting for users grouped by the number of years they survived in the cohort.}
%\label{fig:avr_posts_per_user_cohorts_relative}
%\end{figure}
%% DC 12: The captions need to be longer than one line, but on average shorter than this.  The first set of figures probably wants longer-than-usual captions to explain what's going on (and you do good to not re-explain things later), but the analysis probably has to go to the body text. 

%% DC 12: The paper is 15 pages, and doesn't have a proper intro or related work section yet.  I think the cohort-in-cohort analysis (breaking down a cohort into subcohorts based on number of years survived) might be interesting despite what I'm afraid are weird right-censoring effects at the end of each year.  But there isn't enough space for all of them, and might not be space for even one.
%% DC 12: Another option would be to only show the cohorts with more than a couple of years of data, 2008-2011.  This could be justified and also would save some space, or to show all of them for the first one and two illustrative, representative examples for the rest. 


Implicitly, Figure~\ref{fig:overall_posts}b suggests that older (in the sense of first account activity) users are more active than newer ones, raising the question of whether newer users
are likely to eventually follow in older users' footsteps.  Analyzing users' behavior by cohort, grouping them by account creation year, is one reasonable way to address this question.  Figure~\ref{fig:avr_posts_per_user_over_time_cohorts}a shows our first attempt at this analysis.  This figure already shows a significant cohort effect: users from latter cohorts appear to level off at a significantly lower posting average than users from earlier cohorts.  

However, the figure also has an awkward anomaly, the sharp increase in the average number of posts at the end of each cohort's first calendar year in Figure~\ref{fig:avr_posts_per_user_over_time_cohorts}a.  Since we segmented our users by cohorts, by the end of each year onwards, we do not have users joining the network any more and the influx of low posting, low survival users stops. To support that it is indeed the case that these users are causing these effects, we need yet other representations of the users' evolution.

The fact that users in their early existence have a low posting average can be seen in the user-time referential Figure~\ref{fig:avr_posts_per_user_over_time_cohorts}b. These account for the lower values in the cohort year for the in Figure~\ref{fig:avr_posts_per_user_over_time_cohorts}a. We could, however, imagine that low posting users would keep around after the end of the cohort year and keep dragging the average down. Figure~\ref{fig:avr_posts_per_user_for_surviving_year} show that this is not the case. It shows, for the years of 2010, 11 and 12 \footnote{We only show these figures for a matter of space, but the same trends are observed for the other cohorts.} that, when segmenting users by the number of years they survived in the network, the low posting ones are the first to die.



%% DC 10: A little redundant.  
% This is particularly true for the first month, specially considering that there are many user accounts that are created and only show activity for a single day in reddit, which likely brings the average down.


%The averages over the cohort year is lower because users are constantly being created over the year. Once you move past the cohort year, the user creation halts (including the high number of ``throw away accounts'') and we only observe the ``death'' of users, that has a strong impact in the count of users for the average, therefore the significant discontinuity by the end of the cohort year. Here we observe that different years level in different values for posts per user, having older users posting more than younger users as a general trend. We also observe that the overall average levels at a lower value than the cohorts also for the fact that it takes into consideration the users that are being created at all points.

%% DC 10: I get tired of saying that; it would be useful to define "account creation" as the data handling part earlier as the first visible post in the dataset and just note that they actually created their account earlier than that.

\label{fig:avr_posts_per_user_for_surviving_year}
\end{figure*}

%We can largely account for this by still treating users as cohorts based on the year they first posted to reddit, but adjusting the time reference to be relative to the user's first post rather than clock time as we did before.  Figure~\ref{fig:avr_posts_per_user_cohorts_relative} presents this view of the data.

%% DC 10: Part of me would be curious about either an inset for the first three months, and/or a log-2 scale for time where the first year gets half the frame, etc.  My guess is that the log scale is hard to read because it's an unusual way to present time, but it does have an advantage in that most of the data is on the "left" of the graph and that would emphasize attention toward it, maybe.
Figure~\ref{fig:avr_posts_per_user_over_time_cohorts}b actually reveals more than just why we see the anomaly on the Figure~\ref{fig:avr_posts_per_user_over_time_cohorts}a. In the long run, a striking pattern emerges: different cohorts stabilize in different levels of behavior, and in particular, the steady state activity for surviving users goes down for every year from 2008 to 2012.
%It shows that 2008 has a much slower increase of the average number of posts per surviving user than the other cohorts in the first year. Also, 2009 and 2010 have the sharpest increase in the same period. 
Since Figure \ref{fig:avr_posts_per_user_for_surviving_year} tells us that the main reason why these curves increase is because the low posting users are dying sooner, it means that a higher number of low-posting users are surviving in the later cohorts. It is also important to notice that Figure \ref{fig:avr_posts_per_user_for_surviving_year} shows that users are more likely to post less as they live on.

%, and not because users post more as they live longer. 
%Therefore, how steep the curves in Figure~\ref{fig:avr_posts_per_user_over_time_cohorts}b are is related to how many low posting users joined in that cohort and how fast they died.
%It suggests that there may not be strong cohort effects early in a user's lifespan, although even after six months users in the most recent 2012 and 2013 cohorts appear to be less active than those in earlier groups.  


%Also, Figure \ref{fig:avr_posts_per_user_for_surviving_year} tells us that the main reason why these curves increase is because the low posting users are dying, and not because users, as they live longer, they post more, as a naive interpretation of Figure~\ref{fig:overall_posts}b would suggest. 
%In fact, as you live on, you are more likely to post less, with the difference that if you start from a low level to begin with, you are likely to live a short time. These clear patterns suggest that, when conditioned on cohorts, posting activity can be a good predictor of survival.

%% DC 10: There is a mysterious question about why 2008 ramps up more slowly, that I would interpret in the "there was less to comment on" framing that we've chatted about before.  You could actually do an analysis to test this, where for each user, the number of posts in a month is normalized by the number of posts made in reddit in that month: that is, how active is the user relative to the total amount of activity in reddit.  This is _not_ a linear scaling when the analysis is relative to the user's initial start date, and I would be curious to see what it showed.
%% Sam 14: There is an important point here that I think we did not explore properly. The fact that we count surviving users makes the interpretation of the user-time referential figures hard. This happens because we do not know if it is increasing because surviving users are indeed increasing their activity or because the ones dying are the low activity ones. That is why I made the sets of figures for each cohort. But there is more: the cohorted curves from the user-referential (particularly 2008) might not be increasing because in these cohorts the low activity keep around, pulling the average down, but they don't die, while in some other cohorts they might die and let the average go up. This kind of comprimises some of these analysis in my opinion.
%% Actually, when we control for the surviving time in the set of pictures for each cohort, we see that the posting per user is going down. This actually means that, for the average to increase, low activity users have to die, and if it doesn't increase, it is because low activity users are sticking around.
%% This makes the interpretation of the user-referential cohorted picture more like the ``speed'' at which low activity users are dying entangled with the ``mixture'' of low and high activity users that joined the network. If the curve goes up fast, it means that the low activity die faster in that cohort. If it goes up slower, they die more slowly. How fast and how slow they can go also depends on how many low activity versus high activity we have in each cohort. E.g.: 2009 might have 10 low and 10 high, and the 10 low die in the 1st year, so the average jumps to a high value fast, while 2013 might have 1000 low and 10 high, and the low activity are not dying so fast. So it would be natural, even if users were not to die, for 2013 to be lower. If they die, and do so more slowly (assuming independence, which might not be the case), the curve would increase slower than 2009.
%% The curve does say what a user looks like, on average, given that he has survived x time. But does not mean that users are evolving in that way.

They show the average comment length for users segmented by the number of years that the user survived in the network.}
\label{fig:comment_length}
\end{figure*}

In addition to the raw number of posts, comments length can also be considered as a proxy for user effort in the network. Users that type more put more of their time in the network, contribute with more content and might create stronger ties with the community. Similarly to what we did for the average posting per user, we analyze the overall average and cohorted trends.

%\caption{Average comment length over time for cohorts on user creation time superimposed over the trend for the total of users.

This might indicate how the new users might be just adopting the community norms regarding comment length.}
%\label{fig:fig_label}
%\end{figure}

%% DC 12: If we're going to focus our attention on the median, then we should re-shoot the graphs to also look at the median.
%% Sam 12: Re-doing everything based on median right now is not really feasible right now. I can redo the table, that is easy.

%\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{./images/avr_comment_size_over_time_total.eps}
%\caption{Average comment size (number of characters) over time for the reddit network. We observe that there is a decreasing trend for the average comment size. This means that users, on average, are making smaller comments in reddit as time passes. This, however, hides important aspects of user behavior over time and does not mean that users, as they survive in the network, write smaller comments.}
%\label{fig:avr_comment_size_over_time_total}
%\end{figure}

%% DC 12: Assuming that we start doing the combined cohort and overall graphs, this figure is no longer needed.
%\begin{figure}[!tb]
%\centering
%\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{./images/avr_comment_size_user_ref_total.eps}
%\caption{Average comment size from the users time referential. This shows that comment length made by users increase for users that lived longer in the network, save for a small decrease in the initial time. This, however, is also not enough to say that we should expect the average size of the comments in the network to increase since the users that survive write longer comments.}
%\label{fig:avr_comment_size_user_ref_total}
%\end{figure}

Based on the downwards tendency of the overall comment length in Figure \ref{fig:comment_length}a, one could possibly imagine that the users' commitment to the network is decreasing over time. This, however, might not be the best way to interpret this information. Figure \ref{fig:comment_length}a also shows the comment length per cohort based on the user referential time and, unlike the average overall network comment length, surviving users increase the size of their contributions to the community over time. This puzzling observation is called Simpson's paradox, that we discuss in detail in the next section.

The important thing to notice here is that, while user comments get longer as they stay for longer in the network, younger users start from a lower baseline comment length than older users. Together with the fact that recent reddit has experienced exponential-like growth, the weight when evaluating the overall average for Figures \ref{fig:comment_length}a and b as the years go by is shifted towards the size of the ever growing younger generation, and this younger generation brings the average down since they start by writing less.

As with the posting per user, we can not say if the increase in the curves seen in \ref{fig:comment_length}b are due to the lower effort users dying first or because users are indeed writing more as they live on the network. To answer this, \ref{fig:comment_length}c allow us to make two important observations: first, \textit{comment length do increase inside of each cohort}, no matter how long the user survives. Secondly, as a general trend, \textit{users that make longer comments inside of each cohort die faster}. This is quite surprising, given that we would expect people to put less effort when they are more likely to stop using the network.

\subsection{A Time-Based Example of Simpson's Paradox}

Let us go back to Figure~\ref{fig:comment_length}a, which shows the overall average comment size on Reddit over time. We see a clear trend towards declining sizes of comments.  Across all users, we see that average size of a comment decreases as the community grows older. This could be a warning sign for reddit community managers, assuming longer comments are associated with more involved users and healthier discussions. A data analyst looking at these numbers might think about ways to incentivize or promote longer comments on Reddit. 

However, in the same Figure~\ref{fig:comment_length}a, we saw that average comment size increases over time for every cohort. While later cohorts start at smaller comment sizes, after an initial drop, all of the cohorts show a positive trend towards writing bigger comments as time goes on.  This is puzzling: when each of the cohorts exhibit a steady increase in their average comment size, how can the overall mean comment size decrease?  This anomaly is an instance of the Simpson's paradox, and occurs because we fail to properly condition on different cohorts when computing mean comment length.

%% Sam 13: This paragraph does not make sense to me, rewriting as I think it should be.
%Table \ref{tab:simpson1} provides some clues to what might be going on. For illustration, we consider the change in average comment length from the year 2011 to 2012. Overall, comment length is increasing. If all users had similar average comment lengths, then we would also see that average length across cohorts is decreasing with time. However, people in later cohorts tend to write less per comment. Since their numbers increase year by year, we have a  much larger contribution from them towards comments, compared to users of earlier cohorts. This uneven contribution leads to the paradox we observe in the Table \ref{tab:simpson2}. 

Table \ref{tab:simpson} provides some clues to what might be going on. When we move down the rows, we observe an increasing tendency in each column. It means that the average comment length increases for these users. However, when we move right through the columns, people in later cohorts tend to write less per comment. If we were to average each row, we would still get and overall increasing comment length per year, but that is not what we see in the overall column. What happens here is that the latter cohorts have many more users than earlier ones. Since their numbers increase year by year, we have a  much larger contribution from them towards comments, compared to users of earlier cohorts. This uneven contribution leads to the paradox we observe in the Table \ref{tab:simpson}. 


%% Also changed some things here
Without the decision to condition on cohorts, one would have gathered an entirely wrong conclusion. People are not writing less as they survive, rather those who tend to write less are joining the community in much larger numbers. Knowing this, one may focus on better onboarding processes for newcomers, or evaluate why users in later cohorts tend to write smaller comments on average. 

%% DC 12: This first one still has no real justification: where is the theory or empirical evidence that demographics is what's going to drive this?
%Some possible explanations for this difference in the starting points could be that older users are, again, sampled from a different demographics that is more committed and willing to spend more effort into developing their virtual identity. 
%% DC 12: Again, this is an interesting speculation, but one that's not at all connected to these data.  When papers try to make these kinds of process speculations that aren't supported by either theory or evidence, they usually are not believable.  In some worlds this one could come in a discussion maybe.
%Also, it could be that it is a natural evolution of the community, as older users have taken most of the main space of interests when it comes to creating new subreddits and starting these communities, new users have it all already made and sometimes might feel intimidated or not motivated to create new topics or communities that already exist or that are less likely to compete with the existing ones. In a way, these new users could behave more as lurkers, while the older users are the ones that laid the foundation of reddit.

% DC 12: If we're going to focus our attention on the median, then we should re-shoot the graphs to also look at the median.

It shows that, as users come from latter cohorts, they start from a lower commenting length average compared the the earlier cohorts. This, together with the fact that reddit is growing exponentially in terms of users means that \textit{we have an influx of users that make smaller comments than the previous generations}, although even for them, as they survive, they make longer comments. Just as for the users' posting average, we can not distinguish based on this graphic alone whether users that make smaller comments leave the network earlier or they indeed write longer comments as they survive. Figure \ref{fig:avr_comment_length_for_surviving_year} sheds some light on this question.}

%% DC 12: 2008 and 2009 awfully noisy here, possibly worth deleting on this one; the 2010-2013 are the money shots here for me.  The first point has already been made by the overall, but the second point is a really interesting observation.
%% The y-axes _have_ to be on the same scale for all of the subfigures, though; this "repeated multiples" style demands that because people are going to expect to be able to visually compare them.

\label{fig:comments_submissions}
\end{figure*}

One common question from the literature is what sorts of activities users engage in; this can be used as a metric of community health (cites) or to categorize users into roles they play in the community (cite).  In reddit, we do not have per-user voting behavior, but we do have the number of comments and submissions, and a naive view of this would look at the ratio of comments to submissions over time.

While submissions can be considered new content that an author generates, a comment can be considered as a contribution to an existing content from another author. Since the total number of comments always surpasses the number of submissions, Figure \ref{fig:comments_submissions}a shows the evolution of the overall and cohorted ratio of comments per submission over time for users created from 2008 until 2013. It is important to highlight here that we are not talking about the average number of comments a submission gets, but how many comments a user authors for each of his/her submissions. We observe an increasing trend in the overall and cohorted ratios.

Figure \ref{fig:comments_submissions}b is more informative of what is happening. It shows a clear pattern for users in older cohorts to have a lower comment per submission ration than the younger ones. Also, in Figure \ref{fig:comments_submissions}c we observe that, given the time a user will survive, the ratio seems to level at lower values for users that die faster. This suggests that the increasing tendency in Figure \ref{fig:comments_submissions}b is mainly due to the death of low-ratio users. Also, this indicates that this ratio, conditioned on the cohort, can be a good predictor of user survival.

%% Sam 10: It just occurred to me that although the comment size is decreasing, users might be putting just the same amount of effort, just writing more comments. This figure that shows that the newer cohorts comment more might mean that users are actually typing the same amount, but they are pulverizing more their efforts. Might be worth to comment about it, although it obviously raises the question of why we didn't do it. I can try to generate this results on monday, it is likely easy to do so.
%% Sam 10: Thinking again about it, I raise the question of weather users are getting ``lazier'' many times in the text. This should be included. Can probably make up for the removal of the subreddits section due to the fact that we have a lot of default 2008 subreddits.
%% DC 12: The "lazier" question probably is more of a discussion point, but it's one of many processes (and really, _saying_ that people get lazier doesn't explain _why_).

This distinction becomes more important when we change the time referential and separate users by cohorts.}

%We have found that segmenting users and subreddits by cohorts on the years that of the first comment highlights significant differences of behavior and help us to understand how reddit changed over these years.

The Total numbers are based on posting data from 2007 until 2014, corresponding to our full dataset. The Oct 1st, 2014 onwards numbers are based on the last 3 months of data we have, and we consider this as the current, active reddit.

The Oct 1st, 2014 onwards numbers are based on the last 3 months of data we have, and we consider this as the current, active reddit.

%Table indicates that reddit grew significantly from 2007 until 2012, practically doubling the number of new users per year for each of these years, with similarly significant growth in subreddits. Although the most expansive growth happened in the first years, more than half of the registered users are from the last 2 years, and their behavior is significantly different than previous users, impacting in the overall behavior of the community. For instance, users from the 2014 cohort have a higher tendency to make submissions instead of comments, in contrast with all the previous cohorts.

%\begin{figure}[!tb]

%\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{./images/comments_per_submissions_cohorts.eps}
%\caption{Comments per submissions cohorted by user creation year. Here we observe that, unlike the total aggregated graphic, all users are are increasing the number of comments per submissions, but latter cohorts show a much higher level of comments per submissions than earlier cohorts. This brings the initial part of the aggregated user-referential curve up, while the end of the curve consists only of users from the latter cohorts that preset an lower ratio. It is also important to notice that, as these curves move to the right, less comments and submissions exist in the bins, for there are less users that survived for such long periods. This results in some spiky behavior in the rightmost end of some curves due to the reduced amount of data. Just as with the previous user-referential cohort curves, we can not distinguish solely based on this graphic if users are increasing their commenting behavior or if the users that do not comment die earlier. Figure \ref{fig:comments_per_submissions_for_surviving_year} help us to answer this question.}

%% DC 12: I like the idea of trying to put everything together to think about what it means/how these different notions of effort come together.  I don't know if it works, though -- everything looks really close to the # posts analysis for me, and chars per user just feels like another metric.

\label{fig:chars_users}
\end{figure*}

In the previous sections we observed that the average effort per post for older cohorts increases as the users survive in the network. We also observed that users from older cohorts present higher effort per post for the same survived time than users from earlier cohorts. This means that as you age in reddit, you write more per post, and the earlier you joined, the more you write. But we also observed that users from earlier cohorts are commenting more per submission than users from older cohorts for the same time survived in the network. Could users be actually putting the same effort in terms of number of written characters, but younger users do it writing more, shorter comments while older users write less, longer comments? To investigate this, we follow the same steps as in the previous sections, analyzing the overall and cohorted behaviors, over time and from the user time referential.

%\begin{figure}[!tb]
%\centering
%\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{./images/avr_comment_size_user_over_time_total.eps}
%\caption{Average number of written characters per user over time for the reddit network. Here we observe that the average number of characters a user writes per month in reddit had it maximum at around 2010. After that, we observe a slightly decreasing pattern for this proxy for user effort on average in the network.}
%\label{fig:avr_comment_size_user_over_time_total}
%\end{figure}

In Figure \ref{fig:chars_users}a, we observe that during most of the time, the overall average number of characters written per user per month stays between 3000 and 3500, peaking near 2010 and showing a slightly downwards tendency throughout the end of 2014. The cohorted curves show a different growth pattern in comparison with the overall trend, mainly increasing and then leveling at different values, with older cohorts higher than younger ones. The decreasing overall trend happens because the latter cohorts have a much more significant weight in the average due to the increased number of users that joined reddit in the later years. This highlights the differences of the overall trend for the cohorted trend: while the overall shows a slightly decrease towards 2014, the cohorts show an increasing and leveling behavior. This can lead to wrong conclusions if not treated properly.

%\caption{Average number of written characters per user from the user time referential segmented by user creation cohorts superimposed with the average number of written characters per user from the users time referential for the total of users in the network. The overall line shows that, as users survive in the network, the number of characters they are likely to write every month increases. We also observe for the cohorted curves that the surviving users level at different values, with a clear general pattern for users in older cohorts to level at higher values than younger ones, given the same time lived in the network. The partial exception is 2008, that presents a lower evolution in the first one and a half year. Since, as in the previous cases, we can not know if this is because users took a longer time to write more of the low-effort users stayed around for a longer time, we have to further segment these cohorts by the time each user existed in the network. It is also important to notice how the shapes of the cohorted curves are different from the total line. This happens because the cohorts have different weights in the total curve because of larger number of users in them.}
%\label{fig:avr_comment_size_user_cohorts}
%\end{figure}

To further investigate how users evolve in the network, we see in Figure \ref{fig:chars_users}b the number of written characters per month per user from the user time referential for the overall average and the user creation date cohorted curves. We observe a sharp increase in the beginning of all lines due to the fact that a significant number of users only survive a very short time and the total amount of characters they contribute is considerably lower in comparison with the ones that survive for longer. The effect these users have in the analysis is concentrated in the leftmost part of the graphic, which improves the analysis in this referential. We can see that users, as they survive, write more characters per month. This can be due to the fact that users write more as they age and/or because users that write less die first and the surviving ones are the ones that write the most. From the user perspective, we see that the evolution of overall trend and the cohorted ones are significantly different. The overall trend shows a positive second derivative and apparently keep increasing for older users, while the cohorted ones have a negative one and eventually level. The conclusions about how users behave based on this can be quite misleading, specially considering that it is not reasonable for users to be forever increasing the amount of written characters as they survive.

These figures show the average number of written characters per user for users segmented by the number of years that he/she survived in the network, given a cohort. Here we observe that users average number of written characters per month tend to level at higher values the longer one individual survive in the network. For the 2008 cohort from Figure \ref{fig:avr_comment_size_user_cohorts}, this shows evidence that the initial lower behavior of the 2008 curve is because the low-effort users did not die as fast as in the latter cohorts. Also, it shows that the main reason for the average user effort increases as users survive is due to the fact that the lower-effort users die faster.}
%\label{fig:avr_comment_length_user_for_surviving_year}
%\end{figure}

To understand the increasing amount of written characters as the users age in the network, Figure \ref{fig:chars_users}c shows the per cohort set of figures that segments the users in each cohort according to the number of years survived. We can see clear trends of users leveling in different values of written characters per month according to the number of years they are likely to survive. This means that most of the increasing behavior of the user-time referential is due to users that write few characters dying earlier. Also, this suggests that the number of characters written per month by users conditioned on the cohort year is a good predictor of user survival.

% DC 12: I'd probably get rid of the survival part for space and coherence.  We're doing analysis that focuses on the surviving users and should just be clear on that and own it.  We can talk about the limitations of that, and questions around how to measure survival, in a discussion maybe.
%\subsection{Users' Survival}
%
%The simplest definition of an active user in reddit is to set a threshold date and define that every user that posted after that date is an active user and users that do not show any kind of behavior are ``dead''. This, however, is a limited interpretation of how users decide to stay or leave the network, specially if we want to analyse how this behavior changed over time. Also, since our users might always come back to the network at a later time, they might be ``reborn'', that means we have right censored data.
%
%To account for these, we look at a one year window of time for each user. This way, we avoid the right censored data and the possibility that a user might have come back to the network at a later time. Given this, we segment users by their cohort and define that users active in the last 3 months of this one year window are active users. Based on this data manipulation, we present the Kaplan-Meier (cite) survival curve in Figure N.
%
%\begin{figure}[!tb]
%\centering
%\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{./images/kaplan_meier_users.eps}
%\caption{Kaplan-Meier estimator for one year of posting behavior for each user. Users for which the last posting day was in the first nine months of the one year window are considered ``dead''. This graph shows the percentage of surviving users per number of days since it first posted segmented by the cohort year the user joined the network.}
%\label{fig:kaplan_meier_users}
%\end{figure}
%
%As previously mentioned, reddit shows a significant number of ``single time users'' that only post once in their existence. This can be seen in the initial drop in the first day. An interesting thing to see is that, although different cohorts level in different survival values, the ``user decay'' is similar throughout all of them. Not only that, but there is a general trend for older cohorts to die faster than younger ones. One possible explanation for that is that early reddit still lacked in content, with few subreddits to submit and few submissions to comment. This could lead to a higher number of users that did not stayed around after their initial impressions. 
%
% Sam 10: This figure can go if we don't want/can't give a better explanation regarding survival. It is quite common for survival works to have the hazard plot, although I don't fully understand the values myself.
