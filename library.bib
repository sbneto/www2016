abstract = {Socialization of newcomers is critical both for conventional groups. It helps groups perform effectively and the newcomers develop commitment. However, little empirical research has investigated the impact of specific socialization tactics on newcomers’ commitment to online groups. We examined WikiProjects, subgroups in Wikipedia organized around working on common topics or tasks. In study 1, we identified the seven socialization tactics used most frequently: invitations to join, welcome messages, requests to work on project-related tasks, offers of assistance, positive feedback on a new member’s work, constructive criticism, and personal-related comments. In study 2, we examined their impact on newcomers’ commitment to the project. Whereas most newcomers contributed fewer edits over time, the declines were slowed or reversed for those socialized with welcome messages, assistance, and constructive criticism. In contrast, invitations led to steeper declines in edits. These results suggest that different socialization tactics play different roles in socializing new members in online groups compared to offline ones.},

abstract = {People often rely on the collective intelligence of their social network for making choices, which in turn influences their preferences and decisions. However, traditional recommender systems largely ignore social context, and even network-aware recommenders don't explicitly support social goals and concerns such as shared consumption and identity management. We present relevant theories and research questions for a more network-centric approach to recommendations and introduce Pop Core, a platform for studying them in Face book. An initial 50-user study with Pop Core gives insights into tradeoffs around the popularity, likeability, and rateability of recommendations made by a set of network-centric algorithms and to people's thoughts about the idea of network-centric recommendation.},

@article{Alexander2012,
abstract = {The present paper examines determinants of access to two-year versus four-year colleges among college-going youth. Data from the NLS class of 1972 and the HSB class of 1980 senior high school cohorts are compared to evaluate changes in racial/ethnic, socioeconomic, and gender constraints on enrollment patterns. Academic resource measures (i. e., test performance, high school grades, and high school curriculum) also are examined in order to assess the patterning and magnitude of such disparities when academic qualifications are equivalent. There is little evidence of diminished opportunity to attend a four-year college when the experiences of 1980 high school graduates are compared with those from 1972. In general, social background had little bearing on attendance patterns, although Hispanic youth were noticeably less likely than either whites or blacks to attend four-year colleges. Low-SES youth were modestly disadvantaged at both periods, but blacks were somewhat more likely than whites to enroll in four-year schools. Academic resource measures differentiated attendance patterns more than student background factors, but these differences too were not especially large. One implication is that, once youngsters have successfully negotiated the high school to college transition, opportunities to attend a four-year college as opposed to a two-year college are not greatly constrained by either social or academic considerations. In this sense, the postsecondary system is strikingly open. When academic resource variables are controlled, SES constraints on attendance patterns are greatly diminished, affecting only the enrollment prospects of white youngsters--and even for them only modestly. Blacks evidence the highest four-year attendance probabilities and Hispanics the lowest at all resource levels. In general, these disparities are greatest among youth who are most lacking in traditional academic credentials. Gender differences and cohort differences are small throughout.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to distinguish changes in online travel information search behavior among genera- tional (baby boomer and Generation X) cohorts between 1995 and 2000. Although significant increases in travel in- formation search behavior were found across all cohorts be- tween the two periods, the study also found that older baby boomer cohorts reported greater increases in the likelihood of travel information search behavior than Generation Xers at large. This empirically validates the notion that boomers adopted the Internet earlier than traditionally assumed. The study provides explanatory detail using a synthesis of litera- ture across the areas of technology adoption theory, e-com- merce, and sociology. The findings provide an evolutionary perspective of online travel information search behavior among and within generational cohorts. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.},

OSNs, like Twitter and Facebook, became extremely popular and are being used to target marketing campaigns. Key known issues on this targeting is to be able to predict human behavior like posting a message with regard to some topics, and to analyze the emergent behavior of such actions. We explore Barack Obama's Twitter network as an egocentric network to present our simulation-based approach and predictive behavior modeling. Through experimental analysis, we evaluated the impact of inactivating both Obama and the most engaged users, aiming at understanding the influence of those users that are the most likely to disseminate information over the network.},

abstract = {Abstract: Social roles in online discussion forums can be described by patterned characteristics of communication between network members which we conceive of as ‘structural signatures.' This paper uses visualization methods to reveal these structural signatures and regression analysis to confirm the relationship between these signatures and their associated roles in Usenet newsgroups. Our analysis focuses on distinguishing the signatures of one role from others, the role of “answer people." Answer people are individuals whose dominant behavior is to respond to questions posed by other users. We found that answer people predominantly contribute one or a few messages to discussions initiated by others, are disproportionately tied to relative isolates, have few intense ties and have few triangles in their local networks. OLS regression shows that these signatures are strongly correlated with role behavior and, in combination, provide a strongly predictive model for identifying role behavior (R=.72). To conclude, we consider strategies for further improving the identification of role behavior in online discussion settings and consider how the development of a taxonomy of author types could be extended to a taxonomy of newsgroups in particular and discussion systems in general.},

abstract = {As microblogging grows in popularity, services like Twitter are coming to support information gathering needs above and beyond their traditional roles as social networks. But most users’ focused on interaction with Twitter their representations of content is for solving still primarily social graphs, forcing the often inappropriate conflation of “people I follow” with “stuff I want to read.” We characterize some information needs that the current Twitter interface fails to support, and argue for better these challenges. We present a scalable implementation of a partially supervised learning model (Labeled LDA) that maps the content of the Twitter feed into dimensions. These dimensions correspond roughly to substance, style, status, and social characteristics of posts. We characterize users and tweets using this model, and present results on two information consumption oriented tasks.},

abstract = {Open content web sites depend on users to produce information of value. Wikipedia is the largest and most well-known such site. Previous work has shown that a small fraction of editors -Wikipedians - do most of the work and produce most of the value. Other work has offered conjectures about how Wikipedians differ from other editors and how Wikipedians change over time. We quantify and test these conjectures. Our key findings include: Wikipedians' edits last longer; Wikipedians invoke community norms more often to justify their edits; on many dimensions of activity, Wikipedians start intensely, tail off a little, then maintain a relatively high level of activity over the course of their career. Finally, we show that the amount of work done by Wikipedians and non-Wikipedians differs significantly from their very first day. Our results suggest a design opportunity: customizing the initial user experience to improve retention and channel new users' intense energy.},

abstract = {Turnover in online communities is very high, with most people who initially post a message to an online community never contributing again. In this paper, we test whether the responses that newcomers receive to their first posts influence the extent to which they continue to participate. The data come from initial posts made by 2,777 newcomers to six public newsgroups. We coded the content and valence of the initial post and its first response, if it received one, to see if these factors influenced newcomers' likelihood of posting again. Approximately 61{\%} of newcomers received a reply to their initial post, and those who got a reply were 12{\%} more likely to post to the community again; their probability of posting again increased from 44{\%} to 56{\%}. They were more likely to receive a response if they asked a question or wrote a longer post. Surprisingly, the quality of the response they received—its emotional tone and whether it answered a newcomer's question—did not influence the likelihood of the newcomer's posting again.},

@article{Pujol2010,
abstract = {The difficulty of scaling Online Social Networks (OSNs) has introduced new system design challenges that has often caused costly re-architecting for services like Twitter and Facebook. The complexity of interconnection of users in social net- works has introduced new scalability challenges. Conven- tional vertical scaling by resorting to full replication can be a costly proposition. Horizontal scaling by partitioning and distributing data among multiples servers – e.g. using DHTs – can lead to costly inter-server communication. We design, implement, and evaluate SPAR, a social parti- tioning and replication middle-ware that transparently lever- ages the social graph structure to achieve data locality while minimizing replication. SPAR guarantees that for all users in an OSN, their direct neighbor’s data is co-located in the same server. The gains from this approach are multi-fold: application developers can assume local semantics, i.e.,de- velop as they would for a single server; scalability is achieved by adding commodity servers with low memory and network I/O requirements; and redundancy is achieved at a fraction of the cost. We detail our system design and an evaluation based on datasets from Twitter, Orkut, and Facebook, with a working implementation. We show that SPAR incurs minimum over- head, and can help a well-known open-source Twitter clone reach Twitter’s scale without changing a line of its applica- tion logic and achieves higher throughput than Cassandra, Facebook’s DHT based key-value store database.},

In reality, relationships fall everywhere along this spectrum, a topic social science has investigated for decades under the theme of tie strength. Our work bridges this gap between theory and practice. In this paper, we present a predictive model that maps social media data to tie strength. The model builds on a dataset of over 2,000 social media ties and performs quite well, distinguishing between strong and weak ties with over 85{\%} accuracy. We complement these quantitative findings with interviews that unpack the relationships we could not predict. The paper concludes by illustrating how modeling tie strength can improve social media design elements, including privacy controls, message routing, friend introductions and information prioritization.},

Communities with many joint memberships may struggle to get enough of their members' time and attention, but find it easy to import best practices from other communities. In this paper, we study the effects of membership overlap on the survival of online communities. By analyzing the historical data of 5673 Wikia communities, we find that higher levels of membership overlap are positively associated with higher survival rates of online communities. Furthermore, we find that it is beneficial for young communities to have shared members who play a central role in other mature communities. Our contributions are two-fold. Theoretically, by examining the impact of membership overlap on the survival of online communities we identified an important mechanism underlying the success of online communities. Practically, our findings may guide community creators on how to effectively manage their members, and tool designers on how to support this task.},

abstract = {This paper investigates some of the social roles people play in the online community of Wikipedia. We start from qualitative comments posted on community oriented pages, wiki project memberships, and user talk pages in order to identify a sample of editors who represent four key roles: substantive experts, technical editors, vandal fighters, and social networkers. Patterns in edit histories and egocentric network visualizations suggest potential "structural signatures" that could be used as quantitative indicators of role adoption. Using simple metrics based on edit histories we compare two samples of Wikipedians: a collection of long term dedicated editors, and a cohort of editors from a one month window of new arrivals. According to these metrics, we find that the proportions of editor types in the new cohort are similar those observed in the sample of dedicated contributors. The number of new editors playing helpful roles in a single month's cohort nearly equal the number found in the dedicated sample. This suggests that informal socialization has the potential provide sufficient role related labor despite growth and change in Wikipedia. These results are preliminary, and we describe several ways that the method can be improved, including the expansion and refinement of role signatures and identification of other important social roles.},

abstract = {One of the major applications of data mining is in helping companies determine which potential customers to market to. If the expected profit from a customer is greater than the cost of marketing to her, the marketing action for that customer is executed. So far, work in this area has considered only the intrinsic value of the customer (i.e, the expected profit from sales to her). We propose to model also the customer's network value: the expected profit from sales to other customers she may influence to buy, the customers those may influence, and so on recursively. Instead of viewing a market as a set of independent entities, we view it as a social network and model it as a Markov random field. We show the advantages of this approach using a social network mined from a collaborative filtering database. Marketing that exploits the network value of customers---also known as viral marketing---can be extremely effective, but is still a black art. Our work can be viewed as a step towards providing a more solid foundation for it, taking advantage of the availability of large relevant databases.},

@article{Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil2011,
abstract = {The psycholinguistic theory of communication accommodation accounts for the general observation that participants in conversations tend to converge to one another's communicative behavior: they coordinate in a variety of dimensions including choice of words, syntax, utterance length, pitch and gestures. In its almost forty years of existence, this theory has been empirically supported exclusively through small-scale or controlled laboratory studies. Here we address this phenomenon in the context of Twitter conversations. Undoubtedly, this setting is unlike any other in which accommodation was observed and, thus, challenging to the theory. Its novelty comes not only from its size, but also from the non real-time nature of conversations, from the 140 character length restriction, from the wide variety of social relation types, and from a design that was initially not geared towards conversation at all. Given such constraints, it is not clear a priori whether accommodation is robust enough to occur given the constraints of this new environment. To investigate this, we develop a probabilistic framework that can model accommodation and measure its effects. We apply it to a large Twitter conversational dataset specifically developed for this task. This is the first time the hypothesis of linguistic style accommodation has been examined (and verified) in a large scale, real world setting. Furthermore, when investigating concepts such as stylistic influence and symmetry of accommodation, we discover a complexity of the phenomenon which was never observed before. We also explore the potential relation between stylistic influence and network features commonly associated with social status.},

@article{Jennings1996,
abstract = {The importance of factual political knowledge in affecting information processing and political behavior has recently received considerable attention. However, relatively little is known about the dynamics of such knowledge over long periods of time. This article utilizes a national two-generation, three-wave panel study stretching from 1965 to 1982 to address the issue of dynamics at both the aggregate and individual level. Factual knowledge is divided into the domains of governmental mechanics (textbook knowledge), current events (surveillance knowledge), and historical facts (treated here under the rubric of collective memories). Comparison of the two generations shows that high aggregate continuity sets in by the early stages of midlife, with the young generation showing sharp losses of textbook knowledge but gains in other types. Distinctive generational differences appear with respect to certain events occurring at early, formative life stages. The size of the generation gap depends on time of birth as well as time of observation. Individual-level continuity for mature adults rivals that occurring for strongly held attitudes. Trends within the younger generation indicate the same kind of crystallization process that marks many political attitudes. In view of the high degree of individual- and aggregate-level stability among mature adults, special attention rests on the content of the knowledge that is being hardened and internalized during the early adult years.},

Second, we present a microscopic characterization of propagation from individual to individual, drawing on the theory of infectious diseases to model the flow. We propose, validate, and employ an algorithm to induce the underlying propagation network from a sequence of posts, and report on the results.},

The information context, posters' prior engagement in the community, and the content of their posts all influenced the likelihood that they received a reply, and, as a result, their willingness to continue active participation. Posters were less likely to get a reply if they were newcomers. Posting ontopic, introducing oneself via autobiographical testimonials, asking questions, using less complex language and other features of the messages, increased replies. Results suggest ways that developers might increase the ability of online communities to support successful individual-group interactions.},

abstract = {Wikipedia is a highly successful example of what mass collaboration in an informal peer review system can accomplish. In this paper, we examine the role that the quality of the contributions, the experience of the contributors and the ownership of the content play in the decisions over which contributions become part of Wikipedia and which ones are rejected by the community. We introduce and justify a versatile metric for automatically measuring the quality of a contribution. We find little evidence that experience helps contributors avoid rejection. In fact, as they gain experience, contributors are even more likely to have their work rejected. We also find strong evidence of ownership behaviors in practice despite the fact that ownership of content is discouraged within Wikipedia.},

abstract = {Increasingly, we use mobile applications and services in our daily life activities, to support our needs for information, communication or leisure. However, user acceptance of a mobile application depends on at least two conditions: the application's perceived experience, and the appropriateness of the application to the user's context and needs. However, we have a weak understanding of a mobile user's quality of experience (QoE) and the factors influencing it. This article presents a 4-week-long 29-Androidphone- user study, where we collected both QoE and the underlying network's quality of service measurements through a combination of user, application, and network data on the user's phones. We aimed to derive and improve the understanding of users' QoE for a set of widely used mobile applications in users' natural environments and different daily contexts. We present data acquired in the study and discuss implications for mobile applications design.},

abstract = {Virtual teams and other online groups can find it challenging to establish norms that allow them to effectively balance task and relational aspects of their discussions. Yet, in our reliance on organizational and team theories, small group scholars have overlooked the potential for learning from examples offered by online communities. Theories of deliberation in small groups offer scholars a way to assess such discussion-centered self-governance in online groups. The study operationalizes the conceptual definition of deliberative discussion offered by Gastil and Black (2008) to examine the small group discussions that undergird policy-making processes in a well-established online community, Wikipedia. Content analysis shows that these discus- sions demonstrated a relatively high level of problem analysis and provid- ing of information, but results were mixed in the group’s demonstration of respect, consideration, and mutual comprehension. Network visualizations reveal structural patterns that can be useful in examining equality, influence, and group member roles. The combination of measures has implications for future research in deliberative discussion and virtual teamwork.},

@article{McAuley2013,
abstract = {In order to recommend products to users we must ultimately predict how a user will respond to a new product. To do so we must uncover the implicit tastes of each user as well as the properties of each product. For example, in order to predict whether a user will enjoy Harry Potter, it helps to identify that the book is about wiz- ards, as well as the user’s level of interest in wizardry. User feedback is required to discover these latent product and user dimensions. Such feedback often comes in the form of a numeric rating accompanied by review text. However, traditional methods often discard review text, which makes user and product latent dimensions difficult to interpret, since they ignore the very text that justifies a user’s rating. In this paper, we aim to combine latent rating dimensions (such as those of latent-factor recommender systems) with latent review topics (such as those learned by topic models like LDA). Our approach has several advantages. Firstly, we ob- tain highly interpretable textual labels for latent rating dimensions, which helps us to ‘justify’ ratings with text. Secondly, our approach more accurately predicts product ratings by harnessing the informa- tion present in review text; this is especially true for new products and users, who may have too few ratings to model their latent fac- tors, yet may still provide substantial information from the text of even a single review. Thirdly, our discovered topics can be used to facilitate other tasks such as automated genre discovery, and to identify useful and representative reviews.},

abstract = {This paper presents an approach to automatically optimizing the retrieval quality of search engines using clickthrough data. Intuitively, a good information retrieval system should present relevant documents high in the ranking, with less relevant documents following below. While previous approaches to learning retrieval functions from examples exist, they typically require training data generated from relevance judgments by experts. This makes them difficult and expensive to apply. The goal of this paper is to develop a method that utilizes clickthrough data for training, namely the query-log of the search engine in connection with the log of links the users clicked on in the presented ranking. Such clickthrough data is available in abundance and can be recorded at very low cost. Taking a Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach, this paper presents a method for learning retrieval functions. From a theoretical perspective, this method is shown to be well-founded in a risk minimization framework. Furthermore, it is shown to be feasible even for large sets of queries and features. The theoretical results are verified in a controlled experiment. It shows that the method can effectively adapt the retrieval function of a meta-search engine to a particular group of users, outperforming Google in terms of retrieval quality after only a couple of hundred training examples.},

Our findings suggest that Twitter messages sent during these types of events contain more displays of information broadcasting and brokerage, and we observe that general Twitter use seems to have evolved over time to offer more of an information-sharing purpose. We also provide preliminary evidence that Twitter users who join during and in apparent relation to a mass convergence or emergency event are more likely to become long-term adopters of the technology.},

Analysis of such datasets yields important insights (like the "long tail" of user participation) and suggests novel design interventions (like targeting users with personalized opportunities and work requests). However, certain key user data typically are unavailable, specifically viewing, pre-registration, and non-logged-in activity. The absence of data makes some questions hard to answer; ac- cess to it can strengthen, extend, or cast doubt on previous results. We report on analysis of user behavior in Cyclopath, a geographic wiki and route-finder for bicyclists. With access to viewing and non-logged-in activity data, we were able to: (a) replicate and extend prior work on user lifecycles in Wikipedia, (b) bring to light some pre-registration activity, thus testing for the presence of "educational lurking," and (c) demonstrate the locality of geographic activity and how editing and viewing are geographically correlated.},

abstract = {Recently, there has been tremendous interest in the phe- nomenon of influence propagation in social networks. The studies in this area assume they have as input to their prob- lems a social graph with edges labeled with probabilities of influence between users. However, the question of where these probabilities come from or how they can be computed from real social network data has been largely ignored un- til now. Thus it is interesting to ask whether from a social graph and a log of actions by its users, one can build models of influence. This is themain problemattacked in this paper. In addition to proposing models and algorithms for learning the model parameters and for testing the learned models to make predictions, we also develop techniques for predicting the time by which a user may be expected to perform an ac- tion. We validate our ideas and techniques using the Flickr data set consisting of a social graph with 1.3M nodes, 40M edges, and an action log consisting of 35M tuples referring to 300K distinct actions. Beyond showing that there is gen- uine influence happening in a real social network, we show that our techniques have excellent prediction performance.},

However, it is an open question whether the success of Wikipedia results from a wisdom of crowds type of effect in which a large number of people each make a small number of edits, or whether it is driven by a core group of elite users who do the lions share of the work. In this study we examined how the influence of elite vs. common users changed over time in Wikipedia. The results suggest that although Wikipedia was driven by the influence of elite users early on, more recently there has been a dramatic shift in workload to the common user. We also show the same shift in del.icio.us, a very different type of social collaborative knowledge system. We discuss how these results mirror the dynamics found in more traditional social collectives, and how they can influence the design of new collaborative knowledge systems.},

abstract = {Influence maximization is the problem of finding a set of users in a social network, such that by targeting this set, one maximizes the expected spread of influence in the network. Most of the literature on this topic has focused exclusively on the social graph, overlooking historical data, i.e., traces of past action propagations. In this paper, we study influence maximization from a novel data-based perspective. In particular, we introduce a new model, which we call credit distribution, that directly leverages available propagation traces to learn how influence flows in the network and uses this to estimate expected influence spread. Our approach also learns the different levels of influenceability of users, and it is time-aware in the sense that it takes the temporal nature of influence into account. We show that influence maximization under the credit distribution model is NP-hard and that the function that defines expected spread under our model is submodular. Based on these, we develop an approximation algorithm for solving the influence maximization problem that at once enjoys high accuracy compared to the standard approach, while being several orders of magnitude faster and more scalable.},

This occurs if early buyers hold different preferences than do later consumers about the quality of a given product. Readers of early product reviews may not successfully correct for these preference differences when interpreting ratings and making purchases. In this study, we develop a model that examines how idiosyncratic preferences of early buyers can affect long-term consumer purchase behavior as well as the social welfare created by review systems. Our model provides an explanation for the structure of product ratings over time, which we empirically test using online book reviews posted on Amazon.com. Our analysis suggests that firms could benefit from altering their marketing strategies such as pricing, advertising, or product design to encourage consumers likely to yield positive reports to self-select into the market early and generate positive word-of-mouth for new products. On the other hand, self-selection bias, if not corrected, decreases consumer surplus.},

Many studies have discovered patterns in static graphs, identifying properties in a single snapshot of a large network, or in a very small number of snapshots; these include heavy tails for in- and out-degree distributions, communities, small-world phenomena, and others. However, given the lack of information about network evolution over long periods, it has been hard to convert these findings into statements about trends over time.},

Twitter, a popular microblogging tool has seen a lot of growth since it launched in October, 2006. In this paper, we present our observations of the microblogging phenom- ena by studying the topological and geographical properties of Twitter’s social network. We find that people use mi- croblogging to talk about their daily activities and to seek or share information. Finally, we analyze the user intentions associated at a community level and show how users with similar intentions connect with each other. Categories},

abstract = {Various online social networks (OSNs) have been developed rapidly on the Internet. Researchers have analyzed differ- ent properties of such OSNs, mainly focusing on the forma- tion and evolution of the networks as well as the informa- tion propagation over the networks. In knowledge-sharing OSNs, such as blogs and question answering systems, issues on how users participate in the network and how users “gen- erate/contribute” knowledge are vital to the sustained and healthy growth of the networks. However, related discussions have not been reported in the research literature. In this work, we empirically study workloads from three popular knowledge-sharing OSNs, including a blog system, a social bookmark sharing network, and a question answer- ing social network to examine these properties. Our analysis consistently shows that (1) users’ posting behavior in these networks exhibits strong daily and weekly patterns, but the user active time in these OSNs does not follow exponential distributions; (2) the user posting behavior in these OSNs fol- lows stretched exponential distributions instead of power-law distributions, indicating the influence of a small number of core users cannot dominate the network; (3) the distributions of user contributions on high-quality and effort-consuming contents in these OSNs have smaller stretch factors for the stretched exponential distribution. Our study provides in- sights into user activity patterns and lays out an analyti- cal foundation for further understanding various properties of these OSNs.},

abstract = {Information diffusion and virus propagation are fundamental processes taking place in networks. While it is often possible to directly observe when nodes become infected with a virus or adopt the information, observing individual transmissions (i.e., who infects whom, or who influences whom) is typically very difficult. Furthermore, in many applications, the underlying network over which the diffusions and propagations spread is actually unobserved. We tackle these challenges by developing a method for tracing paths of diffusion and influence through networks and inferring the networks over which contagions propagate. Given the times when nodes adopt pieces of information or become infected, we identify the optimal network that best explains the observed infection times. Since the optimization problem is NP-hard to solve exactly, we develop an efficient approximation algorithm that scales to large datasets and finds provably near-optimal networks.   We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by tracing information diffusion in a set of 170 million blogs and news articles over a one year period to infer how information flows through the online media space. We find that the diffusion network of news tends to have a core-periphery structure with a small set of core media sites that diffuse information to the rest of the Web. These sites tend to have stable circles of influence with more general news media sites acting as connectors between them.},

abstract = {Disentangling the effects of selection and influence is one of social science's greatest unsolved puzzles: Do people befriend others who are similar to them, or do they become more similar to their friends over time? Recent advances in stochastic actor-based modeling, combined with self-reported data on a popular online social network site, allow us to address this question with a greater degree of precision than has heretofore been possible. Using data on the Facebook activity of a cohort of college students over 4 years, we find that students who share certain tastes in music and in movies, but not in books, are significantly likely to befriend one another. Meanwhile, we find little evidence for the diffusion of tastes among Facebook friends-except for tastes in classical/jazz music. These findings shed light on the mechanisms responsible for observed network homogeneity; provide a statistically rigorous assessment of the coevolution of cultural tastes and social relationships; and suggest important qualifications to our understanding of both homophily and contagion as generic social processes.},

Recent reports indicate that lurkers make up over 90{\%} of online groups, yet little is known about them. This paper presents a demographic study of lurking in email-based discussion lists (DLs) with an emphasis on health and software-support DLs. Four primary questions are examined. One, how prevalent is lurking, and do health and software-support DLs differ? Two, how do lurking levels vary as the definition is broadened from zero posts in 12 weeks to 3 or fewer posts in 12 weeks? Three, is there a relationship between lurking and the size of the DL, and four, is there a relationship between lurking and traffic level? When lurking is defined as no posts, the mean lurking level for all DLs is lower than the reported 90{\%}. Health-support DLs have on average significantly fewer lurkers (46{\%}) than software-support DLs (82{\%}). Lurking varies widely ranging from 0 to 99{\%}. The relationships between lurking, group size and traffic are also examined.},

In order to better understand how people judge the importance of their newsfeed, we conducted a study in which Facebook users were asked to rate the importance of their newsfeed posts as well as their friends. We learned classifiers of newsfeed and friend importance to identify predictive sets of features related to social media properties, the message text, and shared background information. For classifying friend importance, the best performing model achieved 85{\%} accuracy and 25{\%} error reduction. By leveraging this model for classifying newsfeed posts, the best newsfeed classifier achieved 64{\%} accuracy and 27{\%} error reduction.},

Yet it is apparent that the flexible infrastructure of wikis allows the development and deployment of a wide range of structures. However, we find that the policies in Wikipedia and the systems and mechanisms that operate around them are multi-faceted. In this descriptive study, we draw on prior work on rules and policies in organizations to propose and apply a conceptual framework for understanding the natures and roles of policies in wikis. We conclude that wikis are capable of supporting a broader range of structures and activities than other collaborative platforms. Wikis allow for and, in fact, facilitate the creation of policies that serve a wide variety of functions.},

abstract = {Vibrant online communities are in constant flux. As members join and depart, the interactional norms evolve, stimulating fur- ther changes to the membership and its social dynamics. Linguistic change—in the sense of innovation that becomes accepted as the norm—is essential to this dynamic process: it both facilitates indi- vidual expression and fosters the emergence of a collective identity. We propose a framework for tracking linguistic change as it hap- pens and for understanding how specific users react to these evolv- ing norms. By applying this framework to two large online commu- nities we show that users follow a determined two-stage lifecycle with respect to their susceptibility to linguistic change: a linguisti- cally innovative learning phase in which users adopt the language of the community followed by a conservative phase in which users stop changing and the evolving community norms pass them by. Building on this observation, we show how this framework can be used to detect, early in a user’s career, how long she will stay active in the community. Thus, this work has practical signifi- cance for those who design and maintain online communities. It also yields new theoretical insights into the evolution of linguis- tic norms and the complex interplay between community-level and individual-level linguistic change.},

abstract = {The asymmetry of activity in virtual communities is of great interest. While participation in the activities of virtual communities is crucial for a community's survival and development, many people prefer lurking, that is passive attention over active participation. Often, lurkers are the vast majority. There could be many reasons for lurking. Lurking can be measured and perhaps affected by both dispositional and situational variables. This project investigates social and cultural capital, situational antecedents of lurking and de-lurking. We propose a novel way of measuring such capital, lurking, and de-lurking. We try to figure out what are the triggers to active participation. We try to answer this by mathematically defining a social communication network of activities in authenticated discussion forums. Authenticated discussion forums provide exact log information about every participant's activities and allow us to identify lurkers that become first time posters. The proposed social communication network approach (SCN) is an extension of the traditional social network methodology to include, beyond human actors, discussion topics (e.g. Usenet newsgroups threads) and subjects of discussions (e.g. Usenet groups) as well. In addition, the social communication network approach distinguishes between READ and POST link types. These indicate active participation on the part of the human actor. We attempt to validate this model by examining the SCN using data collected in a sample of 82 online forums. By analyzing a graph structure of the network at moments of initial postings we verify several hypotheses about causes of de-lurking and provide some directions towards measuring active participation in virtual communities.},

@article{Tan2015,
abstract = {Although analyzing user behavior within individual communities is an active and rich research domain, people usually interact with multiple communities both on- and off-line. How do users act in such multi-community environments? Although there are a host of intriguing aspects to this question, it has received much less attention in the research community in comparison to the intra-community case. In this paper, we examine three aspects of multi-community engagement: the sequence of communities that users post to, the language that users employ in those communities, and the feedback that users receive, using longitudinal posting behavior on Reddit as our main data source, and DBLP for auxiliary experiments. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of features drawn from these aspects in predicting users' future level of activity. One might expect that a user's trajectory mimics the "settling-down" process in real life: an initial exploration of sub-communities before settling down into a few niches. However, we find that the users in our data continually post in new communities; moreover, as time goes on, they post increasingly evenly among a more diverse set of smaller communities. Interestingly, it seems that users that eventually leave the community are "destined" to do so from the very beginning, in the sense of showing significantly different "wandering" patterns very early on in their trajectories; this finding has potentially important design implications for community maintainers. Our multi-community perspective also allows us to investigate the "situation vs. personality" debate from language usage across different communities.},

abstract = {The spread of influence among individuals in a social net- work can be naturally modeled in a probabilistic framework, but it is challenging to reason about differences between var- ious models as well as to relate these models to actual so- cial network data. Here we consider two of the most fun- damental definitions of influence, one based on a small set of snapshot observations of a social network and the other based on detailed temporal dynamics. The former is partic- ularly useful because large-scale social network data sets are often available only in snapshots or crawls. The latter how- ever provides a more detailed process model of howinfluence spreads. We study the relationship between these two ways of measuring influence, in particular establishing how to in- fer the more detailed temporal measure from the more readily observable snapshot measure. We validate our analysis using the history of social interactions on Wikipedia; the result is the first large-scale study to exhibit a direct relationship be- tween snapshot and temporal models of social influence},

abstract = {Online social networking technologies enable individuals to simultaneously share information with any number of peers. Quantifying the causal effect of these mediums on the dis- semination of information requires not only identification of who influences whom, but also of whether individuals would still propagate information in the absence of social sig- nals about that information. We examine the role of social networks in online information diffusion with a large-scale field experiment that randomizes exposure to signals about friends’ information sharing among 253 million subjects in situ. Those who are exposed are significantly more likely to spread information, and do so sooner than those who are not exposed. We further examine the relative role of strong and weak ties in information propagation. We show that, although stronger ties are individually more influential, it is the more abundant weak ties who are responsible for the propagation of novel information. This suggests that weak ties may play a more dominant role in the dissemination of information online than currently believed. Categories},

abstract = {The way in which social conventions emerge in communities has been of interest to social scientists for decades. Here we report on the emergence of a particular social convention on Twitter—the way to indicate a tweet is being reposted and to attribute the content to its source. Initially, different variations were invented and spread through the Twitter network. The inventors and early adopters were well-connected, active, core members of the Twitter community. The diffusion networks of these conventions were dense and highly clustered, so no single user was critical to the adoption of the conventions. Despite being invented at different times and having different adoption rates, only two variations came to be widely adopted. In this paper we describe this process in detail, highlighting insights and raising questions about how social conventions emerge.},
