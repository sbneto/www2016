abstract ={Wikipedia’s coverage of breaking news and current events dominates editor contributions and reader attention in any given month. Collaborators on breaking news articles rapidly synthesize content to produce timely information in spite of steep coordination demands. Wikipedia’s coverage of breaking news events thus presents a case to test theories about how open collaborations coordinate complex, time-sensitive, and knowledge-intensive work in the absence of central authority, stable membership, clear roles, or reliable information. Using the revision history from Wikipedia articles about over 3,000 breaking news events, we investigate the structure of interactions between editors and articles. Because breaking article collaborations unfold more rapidly and involve more editors than most Wikipedia articles, they potentially regenerate prior forms of organizing. We analyze whether the structures of breaking and nonbreaking article networks are (a) similarly structured over time, (b) exhibit features of organizational regeneration, and (c) have similar collaboration dynamics over time. Breaking and nonbreaking article exhibit similarities in their structural characteristics over the long run, and there is less evidence of organizational regeneration on breaking articles than nonbreaking articles. However, breaking articles emerge into well-connected collaborations more rapidly than nonbreaking articles, suggesting early contributors play a crucial role in supporting these high-tempo collaborations.},

In this case study of www.reddit.com, a news aggregate Web site whose affordances seem to imply a transient and fluid approach to online identity, I outline an example of a community member (known as “Grandpa Wiggly”) who ran afoul of community expectations of authentic representation of one’s “true” off–line self. I also detail how accusations of trolling were used as a justification for shutting down debates about community expectations, as well as justifying actions against Grandpa Wiggly that violated the Reddit terms of service (and his privacy).},

abstract = {The way in which social conventions emerge in communities has been of interest to social scientists for decades. Here we report on the emergence of a particular social convention on Twitter—the way to indicate a tweet is being reposted and to attribute the content to its source. Initially, different variations were invented and spread through the Twitter network. The inventors and early adopters were well-connected, active, core members of the Twitter community. The diffusion networks of these conventions were dense and highly clustered, so no single user was critical to the adoption of the conventions. Despite being invented at different times and having different adoption rates, only two variations came to be widely adopted. In this paper we describe this process in detail, highlighting insights and raising questions about how social conventions emerge.},

abstract = {The spread of influence among individuals in a social network can be naturally modeled in a probabilistic framework, but it is challenging to reason about differences between various models as well as to relate these models to actual social network data.  Here we consider two of the most fundamental definitions of influence, one based on a small set of "snapshot'' observations of a social network and the other based on detailed temporal dynamics.  The former is particularly useful because large-scale social network data sets are often available only in snapshots or crawls.  The latter however provides a more detailed process model of how influence spreads.  We study the relationship between these two ways of measuring influence, in particular establishing how to infer the more detailed temporal measure from the more readily observable snapshot measure.  We validate our analysis using the history of social interactions on Wikipedia; the result is the first large-scale study to exhibit a direct relationship between snapshot and temporal models of social influence.},

abstract = {In this paper we present empirical evidence on aggregation problems with Euler equations for consumption. Our main results are: estimates of the elasticity of intertemporal substitution for consumption are consistently lower for aggregate data than for average cohort data and the theoretical model is statistically rejected on aggregate data, not rejected on average cohort data. In trying to explain these differences we find that a major role is played by the non-linearity of the estimable equation and by omitted demographic factors (normally unobservable on aggregate data). However, even when these sources of aggregation bias are corrected for, the estimates of the elasticity of intertemporal substitution obtained from aggregate data remain lower than those obtained from average cohort data, and excess sensitivity tests reject the implications of the model. This can be explained as the result of imposing identical coefficients to cohorts who differ in preferences and/or opportunity sets.},

abstract = {{The objective of this study was to distinguish changes in online travel information search behavior among generational (baby boomer and Generation X) cohorts between 1995 and 2000. Although significant increases in travel information search behavior were found across all cohorts between the two periods, the study also found that older baby boomer cohorts reported greater increases in the likelihood of travel information search behavior than Generation Xers at large. This empirically validates the notion that boomers adopted the Internet earlier than traditionally assumed. The study provides explanatory detail using a synthesis of literature across the areas of technology adoption theory, e-commerce, and sociology. The findings provide an evolutionary perspective of online travel information search behavior among and within generational cohorts. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.}},

abstract = {The present paper examines determinants of access to two-year versus four-year colleges among college-going youth. Data from the NLS class of 1972 and the HSB class of 1980 senior high school cohorts are compared to evaluate changes in racial/ethnic, socioeconomic, and gender constraints on enrollment patterns. Academic resource measures (i. e., test performance, high school grades, and high school curriculum) also are examined in order to assess the patterning and magnitude of such disparities when academic qualifications are equivalent. There is little evidence of diminished opportunity to attend a four-year college when the experiences of 1980 high school graduates are compared with those from 1972. In general, social background had little bearing on attendance patterns, although Hispanic youth were noticeably less likely than either whites or blacks to attend four-year colleges. Low-SES youth were modestly disadvantaged at both periods, but blacks were somewhat more likely than whites to enroll in four-year schools. Academic resource measures differentiated attendance patterns more than student background factors, but these differences too were not especially large. One implication is that, once youngsters have successfully negotiated the high school to college transition, opportunities to attend a four-year college as opposed to a two-year college are not greatly constrained by either social or academic considerations. In this sense, the postsecondary system is strikingly open. When academic resource variables are controlled, SES constraints on attendance patterns are greatly diminished, affecting only the enrollment prospects of white youngsters--and even for them only modestly. Blacks evidence the highest four-year attendance probabilities and Hispanics the lowest at all resource levels. In general, these disparities are greatest among youth who are most lacking in traditional academic credentials. Gender differences and cohort differences are small throughout.},

abstract = {The 1972-84 trend in antiblack prejudice in the United States is decomposed with the use of a better method for isolating the cohort replacement component of a trend. Three major findings emerge. First, antiblack prejudice (as measured by questions in the General Social Survey) has declined in recent years; this is true for the South, for the non-South, and for the United States as a whole. Second, the decline in prejudice stems from cohort replacement (the replacement of older, more prejudiced birth cohorts with younger, less prejudiced ones) as well as from attitude change itself; in fact, in some instances cohort replacement is the more important source of the decline. Third, antiblack prejudice is declining more rapidly in the South; as a result, the regional difference in antiblack prejudice is shrinking.},

abstract ={The importance of factual political knowledge in affecting information processing and political behavior has recently received considerable attention. However, relatively little is known about the dynamics of such knowledge over long periods of time. This article utilizes a national two-generation, threewave panel study stretching from 1965 to 1982 to address the issue of dynamics at both the aggregate and individual level. Factual knowledge is divided into the domains of governmental mechanics (textbook knowledge), current events (surveillance knowledge), and historical facts (treated here under the rubric of collective memories). Comparison of the two generations shows that high aggregate continuity sets in by the early stages of midlife, with the young generation showing sharp losses of textbook knowledge but gains in other types. Distinctive generational differences appear with respect to certain events occurring at early, formative life stages. The size of the generation gap depends on time of birth as well as time of observation. Individual-level continuity for mature adults rivals that occurring for strongly held attitudes. Trends within the younger generation indicate the same kind of crystallization process that marks many political attitudes. In view of the high degree of individual-and aggregate-level stability among mature adults, special attention rests on the content of the knowledge that is being hardened and internalized during the early adult years.},

abstract ={
Certain aspects of the concept of an “active” mass media audience are explored and two dimensions of audience activity identified. The first activity dimension centers on the qualitative orientation of audiences toward the communication process. Audiences are seen as being “selective,”“involved,” or in a “using” relationship to communications. The second activity dimension relates to specific phases in the communication sequence and includes a preexposure period, exposure itself, and a postexposure time. Based on these two dimensions (audience orientation and temporal sequence), a typology of nine audience “activities” is developed. Empirical measures of three types of activity are derived and tested, with audiences found to vary considerably with regard to their “activeness.” A model that links audience activity to uses and gratifications and to exposure is then proposed.

In this study we examined how the influence of  ” elite” vs.  ” common” users changed over time in Wikipedia. The results suggest that although Wikipedia was driven by the influence of  ” elite” users early on, more recently there has been a dramatic shift in workload to the  ” common” user. We also show the same shift in del.icio.us, a very different type of social collaborative knowledge system. We discuss how these results mirror the dynamics found in more traditional social collectives, and how they can influence the design of new collaborative knowledge systems.}},
