\section{Conclusions}

This work addresses some aspects of how to analyse the evolution of a social network and how to apply and avoid some pitfalls of cohort analysis. To do so, we analyse the reddit network and provide insights on the users posting behavior evolution, we identify a general tendency of newer users to write smaller comments and we discuss user survival from empirical standpoint. 

We also analyse subreddits evolution, considering the volume of activity, how commenting and submitting change in function of cohorts and the matter of community survival as subreddits can be seen as independent communities.
