Understanding the evolution of users in a social network is essential for a variety of tasks: monitoring community health, predicting individual user trajectories, and supporting effective recommendations, among others.  Many works aim at explaining these temporal aspects of evolution. Some adopt a point of view of the whole network and try to understand general patterns of behavior \cite{Zhu2014, Kooti2010}, while others adopt a user-centric point of view and try to model \cite{Correa2010, Priedhorsky2007, Panciera2009, Welser2011} or predict \cite{Danescu-niculescu-mizil2013} individuals' behavior.

These approaches often combine all available data into aggregate analyses of the whole community over its entire history.  This can be a natural response to limitations in the amount of available data:  datasets may capture a small part of the community's history \cite{Artzi2012}; timestamps may not be available \cite{Priedhorsky2007, Pujol2010}; snapshots may provide limited views of the community \cite{Cosley2010}; or the community itself may be small \cite{Lewis2008}.  Aggregate time-based analyses are also a natural first way to address questions of community evolution.

However, we argue that many of these aggregated views are misleading. The conditions under which users join the community may vary greatly over time in ways that might impact their behavior \cite{Miller2015}.  Among other things, popularity, purpose, features, interface, and algorithms can change: Wikipedia circa 2005 and circa 2015 are very different, as are Facebook of 2005 and 2015.  Analyses---including some of our own past work---that fail to account for this change may miss important details of what is really going on.

We support this argument through an analysis of user effort in Reddit, one of the most popular and long-running online communities, based on a very large, recently released dataset of posting behavior.  We address a number of questions commonly raised about users' effort in online communities: how active are users, how hard do they work, and what kinds of things do they do?  In each case, we compare aggregate analyses of posting behavior to ones that treat users in Reddit as yearly cohorts, and views that focus on calendar time versus user-referential views that normalize behavior based on the date of a user's first visible activity.  We also look at differences within yearly cohorts, focusing on how behavior differs between shorter and longer-lived users within each cohort.

We find that these accountings for time reveal insights about Reddit beyond what commonly performed aggregate analyses can provide.  Users who join Reddit earlier post more and longer comments than those who join later, while users who survive longer start out both more active and more likely to comment than submit versus users who leave Reddit early; none of these findings are obvious from aggregate views of user behavior.  

Further, we find that aggregate analysis can be downright misleading.  For instance, although average comment length decreases over time in an aggregate view, the comment length for surviving users increases over time in every cohort.  Likewise, an aggregate analysis suggests that longer-lived users post more over time; this is not the case.  Instead, users come into Reddit as active as they will ever be (akin to Panciera et al.'s finding that Wikipedians are ``born, not made'' \cite{Panciera2009}), and the rise in average activity for surviving users over time is driven by lower-activity users leaving early.

We see this paper as both making specific contributions to understanding behavior in Reddit and a more general contribution around the importance of considering change over time in analyzing online communities.
