\section{Time matters} 
\subsection{Why accounting for time is important}

Communities grow and, with time, die. For any community, its users play a role in its evolution, but they are also simultaneously affected by the evolution of the community. Untangling this interplay can help make sense of patterns of activity in a community.

One useful way to understand the evolution of a community and its users is through time, as it provides a linear account of the growth (or decay) of overall activity, types of content, social norms, and structure of communities. To account for time, users on online communities are differentiated based on their age, such as when modeling their preferences \cite{McAuley2013} or analyzing the evolution of their language \cite{Danescu-niculescu-mizil2013}. These analyses uncover insights about the lifecycle of a user in a community: users' preferences and behavior change with their age in a community \cite{Panciera2010}, and their early experiences and activity shape future outcomes predictably \cite{Tan2015,Yang2009,Panciera2009, Miller2015}. 

However, much of past work on online communities ignores the time at which a user joins the community and analyzes all users together, irrespective of when they joined a community. 
This might be a mistake: communities may grow denser or sparser with time \cite{Leskovec2005}, develop new norms \cite{Kooti2010} and/or enact policies and rules guiding people's behavior \cite{Butler2008}.
These changes mean that people experience different versions of a community at different times, which can, in turn, affect their observed behavior. This interaction with the state of a community can confound conclusions about people's behavior, because the differences one observes may simply be due to changes in the community, rather than any significant change in the outcome variable of interest or the user population.  


\subsection{Cohorts are analytically useful}

To prevent such confounding, a common unit of analysis to control for such biases is cohort analysis, widely used in fields such as sociology \cite{Mason2012,Glenn2005}, economics \cite{Attanasio1993,Beldona2005}, and medicine \cite{Howartz1996,Davis2010}. A cohort is defined as a group of people who share a common characteristic, generally with respect to time. For example, people born in the same year, or those who joined a school at the same time, or got exposed to an intervention at similar times can be considered as cohorts. Such people in a cohort can be assumed to be exposed to the same state of the world and thus are more comparable to each other than people in other cohorts. 

For example, sociological studies often use students who join a school in the same year to understand the effect of interventions \cite{Goyette2008,Alexander2012}, and condition on the year in which people were born to understand people's  behavior, such as variations in financial decisions-making \cite{Attanasio1993} or opinions on issues \cite{Firebaugh1988,Jennings1996}. Similarly, medical studies interpret effects of drugs using cohorts of people with the same age group or lifelong exposure to correlated conditions \cite{Howartz1996,Davis2010}.

Recent work shows that the importance of cohorts transfers to online communities as well. Just as people's behavior varies according to their biological age, their experience in an online community may vary with their age in the community and their year of joining. In Wikipedia, for example, we find substantial differences in the activities of cohorts of users who joined earlier versus those who joined later \cite{Welser2011}. Similarly, on review websites, users who join later tend to adopt different phrases than the older users who had joined earlier \cite{Danescu-niculescu-mizil2013}.

\subsection{What might cause these differences?}

These differences in activity between cohorts may be due to a number of reasons. It could be due to selection effects: people who are enthusiastic about a community or its goals are more likely to self-select as early members of a community, while others may be more likely to join later \cite{Li2008}. 

The norms in community may change over time, which could explain why users in later cohorts may behave differently. In many cases, it is a bottom-up process. Kooti et al. \cite{Kooti2010} showed that social conventions can define the evolution of a community and the early adopters play a major role in designing these conventions, even if at the time this is not known by them. Examples include adoption of `RT', a retweeting norm by Twitter users and the subsequent introduction of the Retweet button on Twitter \cite{Kooti2010}; change in language use by new and old users on review websites \cite{Danescu-niculescu-mizil2013}; and assumptions of clear roles and responsibilities on Wikipedia \cite{Kittur2007a}. In other cases, it may be directed by the community managers. For instance, the makers of Digg unilaterally changed the nature of the community by introducing a new version of the website, leading to a sudden change in norms and behavior in the community \cite{Ingram2014,Lardinois2014}. 

The growth of a community may also affect people's behavior. Successful communities often grow very rapidly, which can be both good and bad for people's experience with the community. On one hand, growth would imply availability of a larger chunk of content to choose from. On the other, it might be harder to connect to others and get responses in a bigger community. A community may also need to adopt new rules and policies to manage growth and newcomers, as in the evolution of Wikipedia \cite{Choi2010,Bryant2005}, and in those cases, the experience of later cohorts of users may be vastly different from the initial ones who joined before formal rules were in place. 

Finally, patterns of use may change because the overall population of Internet users is still changing. As more and different people become connected with the web, their influx may lead to observed change in activity patterns.  This also affects technology use: people who did not grow up in a technological environment differ in their social media and search usage compared to younger generations\cite{Correa2010,Beldona2005}. 

%% Sam 8: Reworked this paragraph, added what was our initial research question and some cues on what we are going to see later on
All of the above reasons suggest that users from different cohorts are likely to be different, which has also been demonstrated in online and offline communities \cite{Ryder1965,Danescu-niculescu-mizil2013,Prensky2001,Correa2010}. In this paper, our motivating research question was ``How users' behavior evolve when accounting for cohorts?''. To do so, we considered as behavior their activity levels, effort when commenting and kinds of contributions in the network. As we will see, users from different cohorts exhibit significant differences in behavior. More than that, we find that not accounting for underlying time-evolving processes of the network might lead to wrong conclusions about their behavior.
%% Sam 8: Removing this, too vague
%Accounting for these differences can be helpful for making conclusions about outcomes of interest, such as user's activity levels, their survival, among many other possibilities.
