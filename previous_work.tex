\section{Previous Work}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The Taste for Privacy: An Analysis of College Student Privacy Settings in an Online Social Network \cite{Lewis2008}: Studies which characteristics are predictive of whether or not users are going to set their profile as public or private in Facebook. Raises questions about the limitations of the work because data collected came from a single cohort of users in a college.

    \item Social selection and peer influence in an online social network \cite{Lewis2012a}: Yet another study based on a single cohort of Facebook data for college students. Discuss the relationship between homophily in creating connections and influence over the course of a connection.

    \item Who interacts on the Web?: The intersection of users' personality and social media use \cite{Correa2010}: Studies how personality traits correlate with social media usage controlling for demographic variables age, gender, race, education and income. One of the research questions was whether user age cohorts influence social media usage. They found significant correlation of some personality traits with social media usage for the younger cohort (users from 18 to 29). They also acknowledge the lack of research on how age influences interaction on social media, pointing out that significant differences emerge from people that grew on a digital environment when compared to the ones that were introduced to the technology at a later time.

    \item ``I LOVE THIS SITE!'' vs. ``It's a little girly'': Perceptions of and Initial User Experience with Pinterest \cite{Miller2015}: Initial experience matters! 

    \item No Country for Old Members : User Lifecycle and Linguistic Change in Online Communities \cite{Danescu-niculescu-mizil2013}: User experience changes their behavior over time but they also come with some linguistic predispositions.

    \item All Who Wander : On the Prevalence and Characteristics of Multi-community Engagement \cite{Tan2015}: Survival does depend on user initial activities.

    \item Wikipedians are Born, Not Made \cite{Panciera2009}: Users do have predispositions. Does that mean they do not change and we are simply sampling differently?

    \item Creating , Destroying , and Restoring Value in Wikipedia \cite{Priedhorsky2007}: Not clear where it fits.

    \item The Impact of Membership Overlap on the Survival of Online Communities \cite{Zhu2014}: The survival of communities depends on the type of users that participate in it, and sharing certain types of users --- core members from other communities that are not core members in the focal community --- can be beneficial for community survival. Also, concepts of young and mature communities play a important role when analyzing community activity level, where young communities benefit from sharing members from matures communities. 

    \item No Country for Old Members : User Lifecycle and Linguistic Change in Online Communities: Highlights the interplay on community language change and user adoption of new norms. As a general pattern, newcomers start learning the norms of the community and, as they age, they become more conservative in adopting new norms. Users that are more flexible in assimilating new norms have a higher survival rate.
